**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've started out VueJs and build a card creator app.

**Thoughts** I'm excited about the progress i've made so far. It was very easy though. Hoping for more hard but not heartbreaking challenges later on.
